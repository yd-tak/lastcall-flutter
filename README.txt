# Using Changelog.txt file to update the files in your project.

2. open changelog.txt and go one by one and replace/add/delete files one by one from our provided updated code to your copy of the project.
3. If same files are changed where you have also made changes then after replacing those files, you will need to add your changes back again.

# Using Changed-files folder

If you don't want to manually go one by one and update the app. You can use changed-files folder which contains only modified and added files which you can directly copy and replace in your project.

It will directly update the modified and added files in your project.

Remember for deleted and renamed files you will still need to manually update them accordingly.
